# Default values are optimized for production to avoid having to configure

# However it should be easy to get going in development too. If you see an
# uncommented option that means it's either mandatory to set or it's being

# Rather than use the directory name, let's control the name of the project.

# Be warned that if you change this value you'll need to change 8000 in both
# your Dockerfile and in a few spots in docker-compose.yml due to the nature of
# how this value can be set (Docker Compose doesn't support nested ENV vars).

# postgres Docker image uses them for its default database user and password.

# What health check test command do you want to run? In development, having it
# curl your web server will result in a lot of log spam, so setting it to
# /bin/true is an easy way to make the health check do basically nothing.

# What ip:port should be published back to the Docker host for the app server?
# If you're using Docker Toolbox or a custom VM you can't use 127.0.0.1. This
# is being overwritten in dev to be compatible with more dev environments.
#
# If you have a port conflict because something else is using 8000 then you
# can either stop that process or change 8000 to be something else.
